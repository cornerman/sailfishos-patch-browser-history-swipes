# Browser History Swipes

Only tested with SailfishOS 2.0.1.7 and 2.0.2.48

Swipe URL in browser toolbar right/left in order to go back/forward in the history.
Adds indicators on both sides of the toolbar to show whether you can go back resp. forward.
The two buttons for history control are removed.

Currently very simplistic and only the URL is swipable.
